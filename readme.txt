A plugin to embed a preview of a link, similar to facebook

== Description ==
This plugin fetches an excerpt of an external website link. The excerpt contains the title, description and image.

It also has an option page, which can be used to add CSS to change the look and feel.

This is a modified version of Abhishek Saha's URL Preview (https://wordpress.org/plugins/link-preview/)

Added the cacert.pem which CURL uses for https sites from http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem (the home of CURL).

ToDo: Additional options for link label and target. Longer term, configurable options for sites without an image and selecting from multiple OG images.

Thank you to Abhishek Saha for publishing the original URL Preview at https://wordpress.org/plugins/link-preview/ and for the WP review team for their help in conforming to coding rules.

I do plan on developing this further providing I can find the tuits.
